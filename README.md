#This/That

###This / That is a basic polling app that allows users to create polls and collect votes. Users can also 'vote' on other polls and see how each option stacks up with easy-to-view charts and data.

+ When a user first reaches This / That she is able to log in to a previously created account or create a brand new one with our sign up flow.

+ Once successfully logged in, she is taken to the main dashboard where all of the previously created polls are displayed.
+ She has the ability to click on an individual poll, and when she does, she'll see a detailed view of that particular poll, it's two options, and the ability to vote on her preference.

+ After she votes, she'll immediately see the poll 'score' (number of votes collected for each option) and a pie chart to visualize these results.
+ Then, our fabulous user will have the option to either click 'next' and see another poll, or click on the navigation tab called 'my dashboard.'
+ In her dashboard she can see a form to create a brand new poll and she'll also have a list of her previously created polls (if they exist).
+ To help her stay organized on the results of her previous polls, her dashboard will also show a bar chart visualizing the number of votes each of her  polls have received.
